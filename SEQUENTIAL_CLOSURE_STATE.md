# Sequential Closure State

This file is the durable GitHub mirror for ordered Section/Subsection closure.

## Rules

- Read the current canonical Section plan and live default branch before updating this file.
- Record only evidence-backed DONE state; never infer closure from a chat summary, a PR existing, queued CI, or a single green test.
- Once recorded DONE, a Section/Subsection is skipped by normal workers and is not re-entered unless it is explicitly marked REOPENED for a demonstrated regression, invalidated evidence, changed acceptance contract, or broken later integration.
- If parallel workers produce duplicate closure lineages, preserve one canonical lineage, converge unique required changes, then close/supersede the duplicate and delete the duplicate branch when safe.
- Update this ledger in the same run that closes or reopens scope.

## Closure registry

| Section / Subsection | State | Canonical evidence / lineage | Accepted source / build | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Section 0 — Цільова архітектура 12-6 як повної AI-системи | DONE | PR #3074 merged; candidate `4a1486798d8da3ac59bf1a1e6a7673dcb490afaa`; exact-head CI `37606263374` terminal SUCCESS | `main@d74c5c4f6dee7027ca713b3e6579bb66a5fefaf0` | Current 96-Section plan acceptance 0.1/0.2 is integrated: typed seven-plane architecture boundaries and replaceable cognitive-core/runtime-shell contract. Ruff + full pytest passed on the exact candidate head; merge preserved the qualified candidate tree. No training/data/paid-compute/release authority was widened. |
| Section 1 — Єдина система ідентичностей і маніфестів | DONE | PR #3086 repair merged; candidate `49218c0c581b73bcd0985646f48bf35300b1948c`; exact-head CI `37608406911` terminal SUCCESS; prior PR #3076 closure was reopened and superseded for method-binding regression | `main@b9b3159d1c0c098782451254e55334d91baafa94` | Current 96-Section plan acceptance 1.1/1.2 is restored with fail-closed validator/serializer method binding; merge tree exactly equals the qualified repair candidate tree. Ruff + full pytest passed. No corpus admission/tokenizer-fit/training/final-test/paid-compute/scale/release authority was widened. |
